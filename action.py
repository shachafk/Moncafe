# This module manages the caf√© activities, i.e. sells and delivery, in the campus. When run,
# it will be given an actions file as an argument. It will perform each action by the order it
# appears in the file then print the final database and exit.
# You may assume that the configuration file exists and that the syntax and the data are
# valid but you need to check that the quantity of the sold product is enough. If for any
# reason an action may not be fulfilled do NOTHING!! (Do not print an error message, Do
# not "sale" part of the quantity, etc...)
